= 0.2.0

* Depends on mongo gem >= 1.3.1


* Can no longer set Mongoo.config = {...}

  Set Mongoo.conn and Mongoo.db_name instead (more flexibility):

    Mongoo.conn    = Mongo::Connection.new("localhost", 27017, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5)
    Mongoo.db_name = "mongoo-test"

  You can set these on a model level as well:

    Person.conn    = Mongo::Connection.new("localhost", 30000, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5)
    Person.db_name = "mongoo-test"


* You can optionally set the collection name on a model now:

  class Person < Mongoo::Base
    collection_name "spacemen"
  end
