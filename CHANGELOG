== Changelog

=== 0.5.0

* Introduced an API/DSL for defining attributes and other features.
  The old API will no longer work.

  class Book < Mongoo::Base
    describe do |d|
      d.attribute "title", :type => :string
      d.embeds_one  "sample_chapter",  :class => "Book::Chapter"
      d.embeds_many "chapters",        :class => 'Book::Chapter'
      d.index "title"
    end
  end

* Notice too, there is now better support for embedded docs. See test_embedded.rb.

* General, misc cleanup and restructuring of code.

=== 0.4.2

* Added find_and_modify

=== 0.4.0

* Reverted 0.3.2 and replaced with better, more compatible improvements.
  Major speed increases are still here but it works as it did before.

=== 0.3.2

* implemented some optimizations that provide some major speed improvements
  for instantiating Mongoo::Base objects. Also added a :raw => true option
  to finds so that you can get back a raw hash.

=== 0.3.0

* refactored a bunch of connection and async related stuff. see README

=== 0.2.1

* Identity Map now also stores results from find.to_a, find.each and find.next

=== 0.2.0

* Depends on mongo gem >= 1.3.1


* Can no longer set Mongoo.config = {...}

* You can optionally set the collection name on a model now:

    class Person < Mongoo::Base
      collection_name "spacemen"
    end

* There is a new Identity Map feature available. It will only work when using find_one to
  find a specific id. You need to manually turn it on:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.on!

  If using it in a web application like Rails be sure to flush the map after each request:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.flush!

  The map is scoped to the current thread or fiber. You can also turn the map back off:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.off!
