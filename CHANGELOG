== Changelog

=== 0.3.2

* implemented some optimizations that provide some major speed improvements
  for instantiating Mongoo::Base objects. Also added a :raw => true option
  to finds so that you can get back a raw hash.

=== 0.3.0

* refactored a bunch of connection and async related stuff. see README

=== 0.2.4

* async mode works again, but now you have to manually require:

    require "mongoo/async"
    Mongoo.conn_opts = ["localhost", 27017, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5]
    Mongoo.db_name   = "mongoo-test"

  see test_async.rb for an example.

=== 0.2.1

* Identity Map now also stores results from find.to_a, find.each and find.next

=== 0.2.0

* Depends on mongo gem >= 1.3.1


* Can no longer set Mongoo.config = {...}

  Set Mongoo.conn_opts and Mongoo.db_name instead (more flexibility):

    Mongoo.conn_opts = ["localhost", 27017, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5]
    Mongoo.db_name   = "mongoo-test"

  You can set these on a model level as well:

    Person.conn    = Mongo::Connection.new("localhost", 30000, :pool_size => 5, :timeout => 5)
    Person.db_name = "mongoo-test"


* You can optionally set the collection name on a model now:

    class Person < Mongoo::Base
      collection_name "spacemen"
    end


* There is a new Identity Map feature available. It will only work when using find_one to
  find a specific id. You need to manually turn it on:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.on!

  If using it in a web application like Rails be sure to flush the map after each request:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.flush!

  The map is scoped to the current thread or fiber. You can also turn the map back off:

    Mongoo::IdentityMap.off!
